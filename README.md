## Akuma DiscordBot

This was my **first experience developing this type of bot**. During the process, I practiced working with **cogs**, **databases**, and applied my knowledge of **Python OOP**.

### Features:

- ⚠️ Warning system
- ⭐ Point system
- 💬 Comment system
- 🚫 Blacklist system
- 🔐 Access rights system

The bot is built using the [**Disnake.py**](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake) library.

### Additional Details:

- 📄 **Pagination system** — all lists (warnings, points, etc.) have pagination when overflowing
- 🗄️ **Local database** — all data is stored in local **aiosqlite** databases to avoid database lock errors
- 🧩 **Modular design** — all bot functionalities are divided into separate files (**cogs**) for better organization and maintainability
