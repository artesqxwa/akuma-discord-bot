# Akuma Discordbot
### ðŸ˜Ž About project
My first job developing this kind of bot. In it I practiced working with cogs, database and applying my knowledge of Python OOP. The bot contains:
- Warning system
- Point system
- Comment system
- Blacklist system
  
Written on [Disnake.py](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake) library

### ðŸ‘ŒBot also has:
- Pagination system. All lists (warnings, points) have pagination when overflowing
- All data is stored in local databases built on aiosqlite (to avoid database lock errors)
- In general, all bot functions are divided into separate files (cogs)
